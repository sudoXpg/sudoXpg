# Hey, Iâ€™m Suvansh

Iâ€™m an electronics undergrad at VIT Vellore whoâ€™s deeply into systems and low-level engineering. Most of my time goes into building things from scratch â€” operating systems, CPU architectures, real-time firmware, and sometimes entire protocol stacks just to understand how they really work.

Iâ€™m especially drawn to the intersection of hardware and software. Whether itâ€™s writing a bootloader in pure C and assembly or crafting a RISC-V pipeline in Verilog, I enjoy getting my hands dirty with the actual bits and signals. Iâ€™ve built USB stacks, made my own emulator cores, and designed hardware for edge AI â€” not because I had to, but because I wanted to know how the whole stack fits together.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about how we can make systems smarter at the hardware level. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m currently working on a specialized processor chip for ML inference on drones, with hardware offloading for CNNs and a clean API layer to interface with.

Iâ€™m also into teaching and community work. Iâ€™ve conducted sessions on bootloaders, firmware, networking, and edge computing â€” and I run the IoT club at my university where we tinker with all kinds of embedded hardware.

If youâ€™re building something that pushes the boundaries of what tiny systems can do, Iâ€™d love to talk. Whether itâ€™s architecture, firmware, toolchains or raw signal-level debug â€” Iâ€™m probably interested.
