# Hey, I’m Suvansh

I’m an electronics undergrad at VIT Vellore who’s deeply into systems and low-level engineering. Most of my time goes into building things from scratch- operating systems, CPU architectures, real-time firmware, and sometimes entire protocol stacks just to understand how they really work.

I’m especially drawn to the intersection of hardware and software. Whether it’s writing a bootloader in pure C and assembly or crafting a RISC-V pipeline in Verilog, I enjoy getting my hands dirty with the actual bits and signals. I’ve built USB stacks, made my own emulator cores, and designed hardware for edge AI, not because I had to, but because I wanted to know how the whole stack fits together.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how we can make systems smarter at the hardware level. That’s why I’m currently working on my startup which provides the solution for the problems of tomorrow.

I’m also into teaching and community work. I’ve conducted sessions on bootloaders, firmware, networking, and I run the IoT club at my university where we tinker with all kinds of embedded hardware.

If you’re building something that pushes the boundaries of what tiny systems can do, I’d love to talk. Whether it’s architecture, firmware, toolchains or raw signal-level debug, I’m probably interested!
