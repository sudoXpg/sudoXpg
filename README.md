# Hey, Iâ€™m Suvansh

Iâ€™m an electronics undergrad at VIT Vellore with a deep obsession for systems and low-level engineering. I spend most of my time building things from the ground up, operating systems, CPU architectures, real-time firmware, and even full protocol stacks, just to understand how they really work.

Iâ€™m drawn to the intersection of hardware and software. Whether itâ€™s writing a bootloader in pure C and assembly or designing a custom RISC-V pipeline in Verilog, I enjoy working close to the metal. Iâ€™ve written emulator cores, and designed hardware for edge applications, not out of necessity, but out of curiosity to see how the layers truly fit together.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been focused on how to make systems more efficient, secure, and intelligent at their lowest levels. I believe real understanding comes from building, breaking, and rebuilding.

Outside of projects, I actively teach and run community sessions. I lead the IoT club at my university and have conducted workshops on topics like bootloaders, firmware development, and bare-metal networking.

If youâ€™re building something that pushes what small systems can do, whether itâ€™s toolchains, architectures, or raw signal-level debug, Iâ€™d love to connect.
